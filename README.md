## Introduction
Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is a continuous-time stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows a Brownian motion with drift. This model is commonly used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

## Installation
To run this program, you'll need Python 3 and the following packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
